# Project-Unfocused

- Our primary goal is to build a simple game.
- Our secondary goal is to successfully remember what the primary goal was for more than an hour.
- Third goal is to achieve the first two goals without falling asleep.
- The forth goal is to maintain what was on track in the second goal while maintaining the first goal and not violating the third goal unless otherwise stated in the fifth goal.
- Fifth one? - Document the stuff.
- Six goal is tangents... $\tan(\theta)$...because they can not be avoided.
